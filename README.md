## Overview

Behold the repository, a testament to the diverse and arduous projects undertaken by valiant coders during their quest in the 42 Common Core curriculum. Each project is a step, a milestone, in the grand odyssey of mastering the arcane arts of coding.

## Projects

### Libft
Embark on the voyage to create your own C library, `libft`, a collection of standard functions that will serve as your steadfast companions in many future endeavors.
- **Directory:** `0/libft`

### Get Next Line
Forge a function to read a line from a file descriptor, focusing on the elegant dance of dynamic memory allocation and efficient file I/O operations.
- **Directory:** `1/get_next_line`

### Ft_printf
Recreate the fabled `printf` function from the C standard library, delving into the mysteries of variadic functions and the artistry of formatted output.
- **Directory:** `1/ft_printf`

### Born2beroot
Venture into the realm of server management and virtualization with VirtualBox. Here, you shall learn the fundamentals of system administration and the very essence of operating systems.
- **Directory:** `1/Born2beroot`

### Push Swap
Challenge your intellect with an algorithmic quest to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions. This endeavor shall sharpen your skills in algorithm optimization and data structure manipulation.
- **Directory:** `2/push_swap`

### So Long
Craft a small yet enchanting 2D game using MinilibX. This task will test your prowess in graphics programming and the handling of events.
- **Directory:** `2/so_long`

### Pipex
Reenact the legendary pipe (`|`) function in bash, exploring the creation of processes, the communication between them, and the management of file descriptors.
- **Directory:** `2/pipex`

### Philosophers
Delve into the time-honored problem of dining philosophers, a tale of concurrency and resource sharing. Here, threads and mutexes shall be your tools to ensure that no philosopher starves and no deadlock occurs.
- **Directory:** `3/philosophers`

## Requirements

### General Requirements
- GCC
- Make
